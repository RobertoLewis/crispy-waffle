If you’ve been following along with us as we share a few of our select favorite European cuisines, then chances are you’ve also been anticipating our tasting “arrival” in Italy. Any conversation about Italian culture would feel incomplete without an acknowledgment of its incredible food. The cured and roasted meats like Prosciutto Di Parma and Porchetta, the creamy cheeses like Bufala and Provolone, and the many pastas and wines of Italy are all legendary; and this month we are featuring stellar examples of each. You’ll truly have everything you need to put together a dazzling Italian dinner of your own. Here are just a few of the Italian imports we’re excited to share with you.

We had never talked of religion, but we often talked of marriage.

She was an old world princess whose ancestors had been guillotined in the center of Paris. I was a new age fashion designer whose ancestors had been machine-gunned on the outskirts of Cracow. What did we care? We were in love.

Somewhere near the mellow end of a bottle of Beaujolais the bells of the Cathedral of Notre Dame suddenly sounded. And, as if in reply, she said something about the "infinite power of faith."

"Hey," I said from my new age innocence, "one man's religion is the next man's nonsense."

It happened so fast I didn't see it coming. Something slammed hard against my arm then landed belly up before the gaping balcony doors. Her family Bible lay flat on its back opened somewhere between the Old and the New Testament. Its tissue-thin pages flipped and fluttered aimlessly in the summer night's breeze blowing off the river Seine while she cursed me in low French using words I had not yet learned.

I remember laying alone on the sofa that night trying to fall asleep with a throbbing wrist while pondering the surprising force behind those fragile pages filled with all the precious answers for which millions had fought to the death: Is God one, none, or many? Here, there, or nowhere? Who are the righteous? Who are the damned? And how many angels really can dance on the head of a pin?

Next morning we never spoke of religion or marriage again.
