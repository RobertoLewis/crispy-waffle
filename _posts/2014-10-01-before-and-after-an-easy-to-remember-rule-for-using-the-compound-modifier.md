**Before and After: An Easy-to-Remember Rule for Using the Compound Modifier**

By Roberto Lewis



Learning the correct way to hyphenate a compound modifier will help you to produce well-written sentences with confidence.

Or, perhaps they would be "well written."

When your goal in writing a press release is to communicate the value of a product or service quickly and clearly, you might find yourself using more than a few **compound modifiers**, also known as **adjectival phrases**. Compound modifiers combine two or more words to convey a single idea.  When they modify a noun, they can describe it with more specificity than a simple adjective would.  

For example:

*She drove a red 1966 Corvette coupe.*

*She drove a cherry-red 1966 Corvette coupe.*

*She drove a tricked-out, blood-red 1966 Corvette coupe.*

In a press release, you might refer to the *long-term* goals of an organization, or a *top-rated* manufacturing center, packed to the brim with *state-of-the-art* technology.

But isn't it also correct to refer to strategies that are appropriate "for the long term," or to the phrase, "state of the art?"

When a compound modifier appears in a sentence *before* the noun it is meant to modify, it *should* be hyphenated, in order to avoid confusion as to how the different parts of the phrase work together.

A common example:

*The mayor plans to meet with small business owners all afternoon.*

Are the businesses small, or are the owners unusually short?

*The mayor plans to meet with small-business owners all afternoon.*  Now it is clear to the reader exactly what is small. 

*We were lucky to find a 24-hour pharmacy.*

*Tropical-fruit researchers paid close attention to the findings.*

*Brett has a well-established reputation as a liar and a thief.*

If the compound modifier shows up *after* the noun it modifies, hyphens will usually *not* be necessary:

*We were lucky to find a pharmacy that stayed open 24 hours.*

*Jennifer is a researcher of tropical fruit.*

*Brettâ€™s reputation as a liar and a thief is well established.*

You should *not* hyphenate a compound modifier if part of the construction is an adverb anding in *-ly*:

*She ended her speech with a smoothly delivered toast to the parents in the audience.*

You *should*, however, hyphenate such a construction if it is part of a longer adjectival phrase:

*We cringed throughout his not-so-smoothly-delivered apology to the bride.*

There are also exceptions, such as *short-lived*, which should be hyphenated in every case.  As always, when in doubt, consult your style guide.
