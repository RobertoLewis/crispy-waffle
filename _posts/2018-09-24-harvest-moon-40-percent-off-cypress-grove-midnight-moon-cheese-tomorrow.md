**Harvest Moon = 40% off Cypress Grove Midnight Moon Cheese Tomorrow!**

Tomorrow (9/25) the moon will be full and Autumn will have begun. In honor of the Harvest Moon, we will be offering the Cypress Grove classic goat cheese Midnight Moon for 40% off.

[Cypress Grove Chevre,](https://www.cypressgrovecheese.com/) based in Humboldt County, California, has been producing award-winning cheeses for thirty-five years. At the annual World Cheese Awards, Midnight Moon has medaled every year since 2014.

Searching for healthy dairy alternatives for her children, Cypress Grove founder Mary Keehn taught herself the discipline of goat breeding and the art of cheese making.  She traveled to France to apprentice under established cheesemakers and began commercially producing goat cheeses under her own label in 1983, creating early hits such as the wildly popular [Humboldt Fog](https://www.cypressgrovecheese.com/cheese/soft-ripened-cheeses/humboldt-fog.html).  As the Cypress Grove product line grew in reputation, Keehn returned to Europe, engaging with world-renowned cheese masters to create innovative variations on time-honored recipes and traditions.

Keehn traveled to Holland to partner with local Dutch cheese makers. Four years later, that partnership produced the celebrated 2001 release of Midnight Moon, a hard goat cheese derived from a Dutch Gouda recipe.

Midnight Moon is aged for a minimum of six months, and ships from Holland as an exclusive under the Cypress Grove label. It has a nutty flavor with hints of brown butter and an unforgettable caramel finish.  Midnight Moon will pair well with a Zinfandel, a Syrah, or a rich beer, such as a tripel or stout. Cypress Grove also suggests fig jam and seeded crackers as a flavor complement.

Visit any of our stores to grab yourself a wedge of this one-of-a-kind cheese.
